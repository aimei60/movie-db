# Movie DB

To learn about React, I followed along this tutorial [**Tech With Tim React tutorial**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6D9cBaLViA&t=1201s) to create a Movie Database where users can search for movies and favourite them. After learning about React in depth, I added a wishlist and dark mode features.

## What I learned 

- Learned how to structure a React app using components, pages, and context for shared state.
- Practiced using JSX.
- Used React Hooks (especially useState) to manage local state.
- Created reusable components (e.g. MovieCard, NavBar).
- Understood the React app flow to ensure a clean modular structure.
