# Movie DB

To learn about React, I followed along this tutorial [**Tech With Tim React tutorial**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6D9cBaLViA&t=1201s) to create a Movie Database where users can search for movies and favourite them. After learning about React in depth, I added a wishlist and dark mode features.
