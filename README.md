# Movie DB

A movie search app built with React. Users can search for movies, add them to a favourites list and watchlist, and browse a movie gallery. This project began as part of the **Tech With Tim React tutorial**, and I extended it by adding extra features like a watchlist and dark mode.

## Live Demo

## Technologies Used

- React
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Vite
- CSS3

## What I learned 

- Learned how to structure a React app using components, pages, and context for shared state.
- Practiced using JSX.
- Used React Hooks (especially useState) to manage local state.
- Created reusable components (e.g. MovieCard, NavBar).
- Understood the React app flow to ensure a clean modular structure.
